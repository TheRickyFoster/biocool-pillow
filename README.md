## Overview

**BioCool Pillow™** is a **next-generation sleep accessory** that **keeps sleepers cool and healthy** while contributing to a cleaner indoor environment.  

Each pillow uses a **plant-derived phase-change gel (PCG)** to absorb body heat and a **mycelium-carbon air filter core** that passively removes allergens, particulates, and trace toxins from the surrounding air.

---

## Core Features

- **All-Night Cooling** – PCG core absorbs heat and maintains a consistent cool surface.  
- **Air Purification** – Mycelium-carbon filter traps **dust, VOCs, and micro-particulates**.  
- **Sustainable & Compostable** – Pillow core is **biodegradable and non-toxic**.  
- **Hypoallergenic Cover** – Removable bamboo fiber cover is **antimicrobial and machine-washable**.  
- **Durable & Refillable** – Core layers can be **replaced or refreshed yearly** for longevity.

---

## How It Works

1. **Phase-Change Gel (PCG) Layer** – Plant-derived gel absorbs excess heat, stabilizing pillow temperature.  
2. **Mycelium-Carbon Filter Core** – Passively cleans air of particulates and pollutants near the sleeper’s face.  
3. **Breathable Bamboo Cover** – Enhances cooling while providing a soft, antimicrobial surface.  
4. **Refillable Inserts** – Core layers can be refreshed with **new PCG and filter cartridges**.
